# 💚 Contribution Guide

Welcome to the Gal contribution guide. Feel free to create issue or PR.

## 🙋‍♀️ Question

You should use the [Discussions](https://github.com/natsuk4ze/gal/discussions).
  
## 🐝 Others

You can use the [Issue](https://github.com/natsuk4ze/gal/issues).
Basically, please submit the issue before the PR. However, if the change does not affect the plugin, 
such as the following changes, the issue submission is exempt.

- example code
- markdown
- comments

> 💡 Creating an issue before submitting a PR may seem like a long way off, but in many cases, creating an issue is the quickest route to resolution, as submitting a direct PR takes longer to review.
